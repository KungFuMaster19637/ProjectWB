3.2 - 3.3 Cycle 4
Budget: 54
1. I've decided to up the budget a little bit to give people more options to play around. The budget for the current cycle will be 54. 
2. Wanderer 🆕:  At the time of writing this post, Wanderer has not released yet. With an unknown powerlevel putting him currently in the middle so the players can use him on his release should be a fair treatment.
3. Faruzan 🆕: Faruzan, just like Wanderer is also a new character coming in 3.3 and with another unknown powerlevel. Looking at her kit, she seems to be a niche support, so putting her next to her other element equivalents (Gorou, Sara)  4 cost should be fair.
4. Beidou ⬇️ 1 tier: The captain of the Crux has not seen any play whatsoever due to chambers not being favourable for her. Putting her down 1 tier might influence people's choice to include her in their teams.
5.  Yanfei ⬆️ 2 tiers: With the release of Dendro, it has been clear that some characters that were deemed useless or bad, have been given a chance to shine thanks to the new reactions. Overlooked in the previous tierlist was Yanfei, who performs very similarly to Thoma. Putting her next to this Inazuman housekeeper should balance things out.
6. Xiao/Itto ⬇️ 1 tier: Consequently, having gained nothing from the release of Dendro, both Xiao and Itto were left out on the exciting new reactions. Having their cost reduced should give them incentive to be used again with their also low cost teammates. 
7. Traveler/Collei ⬆️ 1 tier: Dendro reactions seems to be very strong even with the weaker units of the element, making them very good pickups to slot in as just Dendro appliers. Increasing their cost should make it more fair for other reactions to be used. 
8. Heizou ⬇️ 1 tier: Heizou doesn't have a real role at the moment, nor does he excel at anything besides VV compared to his other options. 
9. Ningguang ⬇️ 1 tier: Geo
