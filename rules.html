            <h1>Walmart Bets General Rules</h1>
            <p>1. Walmart Bets will be played on Floor 12 only</p>
            <p>
              2. Every player starts with a budget that is determined per cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Players will then use their budget to buy up to 8 characters to
              use for their run. Players are not allowed to go over the budget.
              Doing do will disqualify their run.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Certain characters and weapons will have penalties based on
              their constellation, these will be mentioned
              <a href="/ProjectWB/shop.html" class="shop-link">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Walmart Bets will be split in 2 modes: Competitive and Casual.
              Competitive mode will hand out rewards at the end of each cycle.
              Casual mode will allow the player to shop with a bigger budget and
              play for fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              6. Each cycle will consist of 2 weeks of trials followed by 4
              weeks of submissions. With how abyss rotations are going right
              now, the first 2 weeks will always take place at the end of a
              Genshin patch. (trials for example will start in the last 2 weeks
              of 4.2 and submissions will open for the first 4 weeks of 4.3).
              Players can only win welkins during the submission weeks
            </p>

            <h1>Walmart Bets Competitive Leaderboard Regulations</h1>
            <p>
              1. The player needs to record their run and upload it to the
              respective channel. The run is only valid if the player clears
              floor 12 with 9 stars.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. You are allowed to borrow other peoples account to submit a
              run, but by doing so won't make you eligible to claim the reward.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Each chamber can be retried until the player is satisfied with
              the run, but the player is not allowed to clear a chamber to then
              reset the whole floor. Leaving the abyss and retrying from chamber
              1 is counted as a separate run.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Every player can submit 3 runs max in the Competitive mode. The
              runs itself can't have the exact same teams, it has to have at
              least 1 new character compared to the previous 8. Casual mode can
              have repetitive teams with up to 5 submissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. The video footage can be edited but if we spot inconsistencies,
              the run can be disqualified.
            </p>
            <p>
              6. We prefer you to include your weapons and constellations at the
              end of the video so we can make sure you didn't cheat while
              recording your run. We would also like to ask you to bind your
              account to the Genshin Wizard bot to verify that it is your
              account.
            </p>
            <p>
              7. In case of a tie, the player with the least budget spent will
              come out on top. In the rare scenario that the budget is also tied
              it will be determined based who submitted the run earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
              8. The top runner of every cycle will be rewards with a
              <b>welkin</b>. A player will not be eligible for the next reward
              after obtaining this reward to avoid a 1 player domination
              claiming all the rewards. You can only claim 1 welkin per year as
              there are around 6-7 cycles per year. The player can still compete
              on the leaderboard but the reward will be given to the first
              player that hasn't received a welkin.
