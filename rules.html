            <h1>General Rules</h1>
            <p>1. The challenges will be played on <b> floor 12 only </b> .</p>
            <p>
              2. Every <b> 4 star character </b> is allowed. Even if you don't
              have a certain character c6, it's hard to balance them per
              constellation.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Every
              <b> 5 star standard banner character constellation </b> is
              allowed. As these characters are usually not gaining huge
              increases in powerlevel, combined with the rng aspect to get them
              in the first place, there will not be any penalties for using
              them.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Every
              <b> 5 star limited banner character constellation </b> will get
              penalties depending on how many constellations you have on that
              character. For every constellation you have above c0, your clear
              times will be increased by 3 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
              4a. The following characters receive another
              <b> 3 second penalty </b> upon using them: Hu Tao c1, Ayaka c2,
              Kazuha c2, Eula c6, Shenhe c6, Ganyu c6.
            </p>
            <p>
              4b. The following characters receive another
              <b> 10 second penalty </b>upon using them: Neuvillette c1, Yelan
              c6
            </p>
            <p>
              4b. The following characters receive another
              <b> 20 second penalty </b> upon using them: Raiden c2, Nahida c2.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Every player has access to <b> 2 5 star weapons </b> . To keep
              things balanced, every refinement above r1 will have a 3 second
              penalty.
            </p>
            <p>
              5a. <b> Battlepass weapons </b> are allowed, but if the refinement
              of the weapon is higher than r1, it will have a 3 second penalty
            </p>
            <h1>Walmart Bets Rules</h1>
            <p>
              1. Everyone will start with a certain budget. The budget will
              change each cycle and will be displayed at the
              <a href="/ProjectWB/shop.html" class="shop-link">shop</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. The player will then use their budget to
              <b> buy up to 8 characters </b> from the shop and add them to
              their team. The cost of the shop units are determined by their
              performance and value from general knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. You are <b> not allowed to overspend </b> on points.
              Underspending on points however, will reward the player with a
              <b> reduction of 5 seconds </b> of their total clear time per
              point not used.

            <h1>How To Play</h1>
            <p>
              1. To enter the leaderboard, you will have to record a video of
              your run and upload it to YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. The run has to be in 1 go. You can reset the floor if you want
              to but you can't reset the whole run by exiting abyss and redoing
              a chamber for energy, that would count as a seperate run.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. After recording and uploading your run, send a link to the
              appropiate channel.
            </p>
            <p>
              3a. If you have the time for it, also put your weapons used, your
              character cons and cleartimes in the description of the video or
              in the channel itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              3b. If you know how the penalty system works you could also
              calculate for yourself what your total clear time is, I would
              appreciate it.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. The leaderboard will be ranked on the following criteria:<br />
              a. Stars <br />
              b. Total clear time <br />
              c. Points used <br />
              Example: Player 1 cleared with 9 stars and total clear time 7:58
              and used 60 points, Player 2 cleared with 8 stars and total clear
              time 7:15 and used 58 points. Player 1 will be ranked above Player
              2 due to stars being more important than clear time and points
              used.
