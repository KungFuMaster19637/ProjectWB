3.4 – 3.5 Cycle 8
Budget: 64
1. Venti ⬆️ 1 tier: The next cycle looks like to be an AOE favoured abyss. One side is particularly interesting for groupers and Venti excels in this niche. Upping his cost should make it more fair to pick him up.
2. Alhaitham ⬆️ 1 tier: Alhaitham has proven himself to be a very valuable Dendro driver and is one of the stronger Dendro characters around. His cost at 6 would have been too cheap in my opinion as his teammates arent usually the most expensive either. Putting him up 1 tier should balance that out. 
3. Ayato/Tartaglia ⬆️  1 tier: The Hydro brothers will return to the abyss with the AOE focused chamber this time. They were put down last rotation because some poor matchups for them combined with their heavy team cost. Putting them a tier back where they belong is the only reasonable outcome.
