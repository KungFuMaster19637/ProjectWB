3.5 - 3.6 Cycle 10
Budget: 64
1. Nahida ⬆️ 1 tier: All fun must come to an end, and it's time to put Nahida back at the throne. With the initial idea of putting her at 10 cost allowing more players to have fun, she definitely is powerlevel wise still at the top.
2. Raiden ⬇️ 1 tier: Raiden has seen surprisingly low amounts of usage, with her hyper team being a bit too expensive too run. As a Hyperbloom trigger however, she still is the premier option to go for over Kuki. But her cost of 12 would be a bit too much for this flexibility. Putting her down 1 tier might encourage players to experiment with more.
3. Nilou ⬇️ 1 tier: With the upcoming rotation having bosses on either side, will make our poor girl a bad choice again. People could still play her with more single target oriented characters, but in the end, her teams don't excel against these enemies. Giving her a reduction of 2 cost should maybe balance it out.
4. Ganyu ⬇️ 1 tier: Ganyu, and to an extend Cryo, has been getting the short end of the stick since Dendro. With some niche teams involving other Cryo units, Ganyu hasn't been picked up since Cycle 6. She's overshadowed by Ayaka in freeze teams, and Meltyu hasn't been consistent for a while, making her an overall poor choice. Putting her down 1 tier should help her a bit.
5. Anemo MC/Collei ⬇️ 1 tier: These units used to be in this tier, as they were among the weakest of their element. But as it turns out, players will opt for alternatives to them as they were the weakest of their respective element. In Collei's case, Yaoyao is just another Dendro applier that fills the healer role, and Dendro MC has better Dendro application.  For Anemo MC it's a bit rough as Sayu, Jean and Heizou in the same tier provide way more than Anemo MC. Putting them down should make them more appealing to pick up. 
6. Diona ⬇️ 1 tier: 2 words: Cryo Shielder. Putting her next to Layla should be fair.
